A console based programming language meant to be like Shell or Bash with the look of BASIC.

Hello World in NBAS:

<code>PRNT Hello, World ;</code>

This code would output the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

To run this program using the interpreter, you would need to enter the above code into the interpreter and then press enter to execute it. The interpreter would then read the command and output the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Installation 
<code>git clone https://github.com/EarthRulerr/NBAS</code><br>

<b>ChatGPT said this about the source code:</b>

"This code appears to be a program written in C++ that is intended to be an interpreter for a custom programming language called "NBAS". The interpreter reads and executes commands written in this custom language, which include operations such as printing to the console, performing arithmetic, and waiting for a specified amount of time.

The code includes several functions that are used to display help and usage information for different aspects of the language, such as the pkghelp() function which displays help for packages, and the help() function which displays a general guide for the language.

The main function of the program is a loop that reads and executes commands from the user. The loop reads a single word at a time from the user's input, and then checks the value of the word to determine which operation to perform. The program recognizes a variety of different commands, including commands for printing, performing arithmetic, and waiting for a specified amount of time.

The program also includes support for "packages", which are additional functionality that can be added to the interpreter by the user. The program includes a pkghelp() function that displays help for packages, and a (pkg.reset)' command that can be used to reset the program to its default state and delete all installed packages.

There are also several error messages defined in the code, such as ERROR 409, which is displayed when an unknown or invalid tag is encountered.

Overall, this code appears to be an implementation of an interpreter for a custom programming language called NBAS. It includes support for a variety of commands and features, and includes functionality for displaying help and usage information for different aspects of the language."
